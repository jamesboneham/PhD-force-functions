#+HTML_HEAD: <base target="_blank">

Repository containing code used to calculate the force functions as defined in the thesis

* Loading Experiment Output

The class =ArcherExperiment= and associated methods are intended to be suitable
for interactive use. The first step is to load a netCDF file created by MITgcm
(or stitched together from various other output files):

#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports both
from load import ArcherExperiment
exp = ArcherExperiment("DATAFILE.nc", chunks=None, verbose=True)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports both

#+end_src
