#+TITLE: PhD Code for Calculating Force Functions
#+HTML_HEAD: <base target="_blank">

Repository containing code used to calculate the force functions as defined in the thesis
/Dynamics of the Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean Circulationâ€”the Role of Surface
Forcing and Topography/ (link to be published post-graduation in May 2024).


* Loading Experiment Output

The class =ArcherExperiment= and associated methods are intended to be suitable
for interactive use. The first step is to load a netCDF file created by MITgcm
(or stitched together from various other output files):

#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports code
from load import ArcherExperiment

exp = ArcherExperiment("DATAFILE.nc", chunks=None, verbose=True)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The forces (Coriolis, buoyancy, wind stress, viscosity, and inertia) can then be
loaded:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports both
exp.load_forces()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Calculating forces
: Writing forces to temporary file
: Re-opening force dataset
: Done

The closures used to calculate the various force functions and the barotropic streamfunction
are all created using:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports both
exp.load_closures()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Generating pressure solver
: Generating A^{OTx} solver
: Generating A^{OTy} solver
: Generating HA^{BT} direct solver
: Generating HA^{BT} residual solver
: Generating barotropic streamfunction solver
: Done

#+begin_src jupyter-python :kernel python3 :session readme :eval never :exports both

#+end_src
